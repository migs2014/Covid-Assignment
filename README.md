# **COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization**
## **Project Description**
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health, economies, and daily life. This project analyzes COVID-19 trends using `"owid-covid-data.csv"`, providing insights into cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts across different countries. Using data visualization techniques, we identify patterns, anomalies, and key takeaways that can inform public health decisions and future pandemic preparedness.

---

## **Objectives**
This project aims to:
1. **Analyze global COVID-19 trends**, focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
2. **Compare country-specific responses** to the pandemic.
3. **Highlight anomalies and key patterns** in infection rates.
4. **Visualize COVID-19 trends** using interactive charts and maps.
5. **Generate insights to help policymakers and researchers** understand the effectiveness of different interventions.

---

## **Datasets Used**
- **OWID COVID-19 Dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`)** – A dataset from Our World In Data, containing information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and country-specific responses.
- **World Population Data** – Used for normalization and comparison in vaccination rate calculations.

---

## **Tools & Libraries Used**
✅ **Python** – Core programming language for data processing  
✅ **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning  
✅ **NumPy** – Handling numerical computations  
✅ **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Static visualizations (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and correlation heatmaps)  
✅ **Plotly Express** – Interactive choropleth maps and dynamic visualizations  
✅ **Jupyter Notebook** – Code execution, insights documentation, and reporting

## **How to Run/View the Project**
### **Prerequisites**
Before running the project, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly notebook
```

### **Steps to Run the Analysis**
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Load and preprocess data** (`data_cleaning.ipynb`):
   - Handles missing values, filters relevant columns, and ensures data consistency.
3. **Visualize trends** (`charts.ipynb`, `maps.ipynb`):
   - Generates various visualizations, including line charts for cases/deaths, choropleth maps for geographic trends, and correlation heatmaps.

### **Viewing Outputs**
- Graphs will be generated within Jupyter Notebook cells.
- Choropleth maps are interactive in Plotly, allowing for zooming and exploration.
- Results can be exported as images (`.png`) or HTML reports for sharing.

---

 **Interesting Patterns Observed**
- Wealthier nations tended to **vaccinate faster**, yet some **lower-income countries** showed higher compliance rates despite resource constraints.
- Some nations exhibited **case surges despite strict policies**, suggesting external factors like new variants or relaxed social behavior.
- **Early adopters of mRNA vaccines** experienced **steeper declines in hospitalizations**, indicating their effectiveness.

## **Visualizations Included**
### **1. Line Charts**
Tracking total cases, deaths, and vaccinations across time.
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("owid-covid-data.csv")
df["date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date"])

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
for country in ["USA", "India", "China"]:
    country_data = df[df["location"] == country]
    plt.plot(country_data["date"], country_data["total_cases"], label=country)

plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Total Cases")
plt.title("COVID-19 Cases Over Time")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### **2. Choropleth Map: Global Case Density**
```python
import plotly.express as px

latest_df = df.sort_values("date").drop_duplicates("location", keep="last")

fig_cases = px.choropleth(
    latest_df,
    locations="iso_code",
    color="total_cases",
    hover_name="location",
    color_continuous_scale="Reds",
    title="Global COVID-19 Case Density"
)
fig_cases.show()
```

### **3. Correlation Heatmaps**
Analyzing relationships between variables such as total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
```python
import seaborn as sns

numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=["number"])
correlation_matrix = numeric_df.corr()

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", fmt=".2f")
plt.title("Correlation Between COVID-19 Variables")
plt.show()
